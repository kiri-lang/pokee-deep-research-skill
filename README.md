## ✨ What Makes This Different

| | Web Search | ChatGPT/Perplexity | **Pokee Deep Research** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Speed** | ⚡ Instant | 🚀 30-60 sec | ⏱️ 7-25 min |
| **Method** | Links | Single query | **Multi-turn investigation** |
| **Depth** | Surface | Medium | **Deep — explores, not summarizes** |
| **Structure** | Raw links | Paragraphs | **Outline + Full Report** |
| **Citations** | ❌ | Partial | **✅ Rich, verifiable sources** |
| **Best For** | Quick facts | Fast answers | **Strategic decisions, due diligence** |

Other AI tools give you plausible summaries. Pokee performs **iterative web searches and content analysis** — reading sources, following leads, building a comprehensive picture you can actually trust.

**Use this when:** preparing for a meeting, evaluating competitors, understanding a market, or any time "I googled it" isn't enough.
